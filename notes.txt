75% of recruiters around the world use an applicant tracking system (Source: Capterra)

For most ATS, if a resume scores 80% or above, it will make its way to a hiring manager or recruiter.

According to a study by Preptel, a job search firm, 75 percent of all resumes are never seen by a real human being. Instead, they are filtered out by ATS without a second glance.


 <h6 className='index-about-suberheader'>There are 2 reasons for this - Your resume is not formatted correectly and the ATS can&apos;t read it. Your resume doesn&apos;t contain the keywrds that a hiring manager is looking for.</h6>

        Step 1 - Identify the job title or required experience and add it to your resume. 

        Step 2 - Identify the essential keywords

        Step 3 - Format your ATS resume correectly
            Use simple, clear language. Using jargon or overly complicated language will just confuse the system.
            Stick to traditional resume section headers like “Education” and “Work Experience”. Avoid more creative headers like “Where I’ve Been”.
            Use a common, easy-to-read font such as Times New Roman, Arial, or Helvetica for optimal readability.
            Make sure your margins are 1 inch on all sides so your resume doesn’t look crowded. 
            Avoid using unnecessary graphics or embellishments. They can make your resume appear unprofessional and could confuse the ATS.
            Avoid using special characters or symbols that the system might misinterpret.
            Do NOT use tables and columns to help organize your resume. These can result in critical information getting garbled by the ATS.
            Use a Word document when you are creating your resume. This will ensure that it looks good and is easy for the ATS to read.
